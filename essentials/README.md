# codingProblems

## About
 
This part of the repo just contains some concept-building DSA theory and problems. If you're coding looking for coding problems from LC/hackerrank, go to root/platformns.


### Basics

####  * Linear Data Structures 

* Arrays
   * Sorting
   * Searching
* Recursion
* Linked lists
* Stack/queues

#### * Non-Linear Data Structures

* Trees
   * BST
   * Red/Black trees
   * Other interesting tree problems
* Graphs
   * Euler problems
   * DFS/BFS
   * Other interesting graph problems
   * Etc (anything interesting basically)

## Basics -> Theory
The directories are made for each DS (and even for some famous patterns and algorithms like Kruskal's algo or sliding window pattern). The theory is just made for the essential information and no extra clutter. Readme files contain the theory and are printable in pdf. 

##  Basics -> Psets: 
In the basics repo, there's theory/visualizations and any problems are generally in the increasing order of difficulty in each pset. However, some psets are more rigorous than others (arrays: searching I is definitely harder than say Stacks - I). Usually, the first 30-40% are leetcode easies, followed my mostly leetcode mediums. Some are leetcode hard in between but I'm not one for spoilers. 


I'll try to make sure that each solution set has its own runtime complexity documented. I'll also try to find out that each problem also contain some requirement for time/space complexity. However, I don't promise that.

Enjoy your visit B|


## Tips:
1. Maintain a google docs / excel spreadsheet to log problems, focustime, and result (bruteforce/optimized/fail) so you could revisit problems later
2. Don't look at the solutions until you have failed on 2-3 separate occasions after devoting at-least 30 mins each
3. Do timed revisions on failed/challenging problems you marked on the spreadsheet.
