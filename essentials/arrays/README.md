# Arrays

## Theory
 
- The most asked, and the trickest problems belong to Arrays simply because there's a big room for creativity. 

Before solving array problems, think the following as clarifying questions: 
- Are there duplicate values in the array, would it affect the answer?
- How big is the array? Does it make sense to convert it to a set? 
- Does it make sense to traverse L-> R or R->L?
- Can you use two pointers somehow to make the problem easier? 
- Does it make sense to sort the array? (This helps a lot!)

### Corner cases

- Empty array
- array with 1 or 2 elements
- array with repeated elements



### Special notes:
- When using an index to iterate through array elements, be careful not to go out of bounds.
- Be mindful about slicing or concatenating arrays in your code. Typically, slicing and concatenating arrays require O(n) time. Use start and end indices to demarcate a subarray/range where possible.
- When you are given two arrays to process, it is common to have one index per array (pointer) to traverse/compare the both of them. For example, we use the same approach to merge two sorted arrays.
