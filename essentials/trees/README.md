# Trees

## Theory

## Questions 
- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- Same Tree
- Invert/Flip Binary Tree
- Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
- Subtree of Another Tree
- Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
- Validate Binary Search Tree
- Kth Smallest Element in a BST
- Lowest Common Ancestor of BST

## Insight
After you do~10 questions, you might realize, Binary tree questions are similar.
1. You use BFS/DFS to traverse in a particular way 
2. You store path values, then use the path values later (look binary_trees/others for 257, 1022)
