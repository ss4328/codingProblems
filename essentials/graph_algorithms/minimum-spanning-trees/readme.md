# Minimum Spanning Trees

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. 

The cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree. 

- There can be many spanning trees. 
- Minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree where the cost is minimum among all the spanning trees. There also can be many minimum spanning trees.

Minimum spanning tree has direct application in the design of networks. It is used in algorithms approximating the travelling salesman problem, multi-terminal minimum cut problem and minimum-cost weighted perfect matching. Other practical applications are:

1. Cluster Analysis
2. Handwriting recognition
3. Image segmentation

## Prims Algorithm
Primâ€™s algorithm finds the cost of a minimum spanning tree from a weighted undirected graph. This algorithm begins by randomly selecting a vertex and adding the least expensive edge from this vertex to the spanning tree. The algorithm continues to add the least expensive edge from the vertices already added to the spanning tree to make it grow and terminates when all the vertices are added to the spanning tree. It is evident that the algorithm gets greedy by selecting the least expensive edge from the vertices already added to the spanning tree.
