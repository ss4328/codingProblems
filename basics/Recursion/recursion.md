I'll maintain the questions list here, along with the function name, and it's purpose.

#Questions: Recursion


1. Find the maximum element present in an array using recursion.


2. Print the array in reverse order using recursion


3. Given a string. Find the length of the string using recursion. 
For ex : Input : str = “Hello”
             Output = 5

4. Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

//what’s the problem statement here???

5. Given an array of integers, replace each element with the product of the remaining elements.
For example : 
Input : {1,2,3,4,5}
Output : {120,60,40,30,24}
