# codingProblems

I'm practicing these problems to develop general programming acumen. These are mostly data structures and algorithms problems which I've compiled either myself or with the help of some very amazing peers that I've had the chance to meet over the years! The repo will be updated as follows:

Linear DS
-arrays
	-sorting
	-searching
-recursion
-linked lists
-stack/queues

Non-linear DS
-trees
	-BST
	-Red/Black trees
	-other interesting tree problems
-graphs
	-Euler problems
	-DFS/BFS
	-other interesting graph problems
-etc (anything interesting basically)

Problems are generally in the increasing order of difficulty in each pset. However, some psets are more rigorous than others (arrays: searching I is definitely harder than say Stacks - I). Usually, the first 30-40% are leetcode easies, followed my mostly leetcode mediums. Some are leetcode hard in between but I'm not one for spoilers :D



I'll try to make sure that each solution set has its own runtime complexity documented. I'll also try to find out that each problem also contain some requirement for time/space complexity. I don't promise that.
