#Questions: Problems on searching – part I

 
1. Given an array of n numbers, give an algorithm where the duplicate number exist ? 
2. Can we improve the complexity of solving the above question, if it only contains the positive elements and numbers are in the range [0,n-1] 
3. Given an array of n numbers, give an algorithm which gives the element appearing maximum number of times? 
4. Can we improve the complexity of solving the above question, if it only contains the positive elements and numbers are in the range [0,n-1] 
5. Given an array of n numbers, find the element which repeats first in the array. For exL [ 3,2,1,2,2,3] -→ 3 is the first repeating element 
6. We are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n . There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Give an algorithm to find that element Ex: [1,2,4,6,3,7,8]. → 5 
*Note : Try to think for all corner cases 
7. Given an array of n positive numbers. All numbers occurs even number of times except 1 which occurs odd number of times. Find that number in O(n) time and O(1) space. Ex: [1,2,3,2,3,1,3]. → 3 
8. Given an array with n+2 elements, all element of the array are in the range of 1 to n and also all elements occur only once except two numbers which occur twice. Find those repeating numbers. For ex: [6,2,6,5,2,3,1] , n=6, array has n+2=7 elements. Output will be. 6 , 2 
9. Given an array of n elements. Find two elements in the array such that their sum is equal to given element K. 
10. Given an array of n elements . Find three elements i, j, k in the array such that 
i*i + j*j = k*k 
11. Given an array of both positive and negative numbers, find two numbers such that their sum is closest to 0. Ex: [ 1 ,60 ,-10, 70, -80,85]. → -80,85 
12. Given an array of n elements . Find three elements such that their sum is equal to the given number 
13. Given an array of n elements . Find three elements such that their sum is closes to 0 
14. Let A be an array of n distinct integers. Suppose A has the following property: there exists an index 1>=k <= n, such that A[1], ........,A[k] is an increasing sequence and A[k+1],......,A[n] is a decreasing sequence. Design an algorithm to find k 
15. In the above question, if we don’t know n, how do we solve it then ?
