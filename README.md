# codingProblems

## About
 
This is a repository for organizing theory and problems for Computer Science Data Structures and Algorithms. Ideally upon completion, this would be a one stop, No-BS repo containing compacy theory, Essential questions, and their solutions (most). This will help you in:
- Really learning/implementing the core CS theory
- Passing coding interviews

## Process: 
The process to follow through this repo is simple: 

### Phase-I

1. Select 2-3 topics
2. ENGROSS the topics theory 
3. Do the essential questions

Repeat 2 and 3 for chosen topics concurrently until all the essential questions have been attempted

Repeat the whole process until you've attempted all the essential questions

### Phase-II
Now, you'd have gained enough acumen to solve better problems, faster. 

Do the advanced problems in an intelligent, excel-powered ad-hoc manner until nothing's left. 


## Structure 

* Arrays: 60 questions
   * DP
   * Greedy
   * Divide and conquer
   * Matrix
   * Intervals
   * Others

* Sorting/Searching: 20 Questions
   * Binary Search
   * Search in Rotated Arrays
* Linked-Lists: 10 Questions	
* Stacks/Queues: 10 Questions
* Strings: 10 Questions
* Recursion: 10 Questions
* Trees: 10 Questions
* Graph-Search(BFS/DFS/A-Star): 10 Questions
* Heaps: 10 Questions
* Bit-Manipulation/Math: 10 Questions

Total around 160 Questions

### Platforms
* Leetcode
* Hackerrank


## Archieve: Advanced Questions

##  Basics -> Psets: 
In the basics repo, there's theory/visualizations and any problems are generally in the increasing order of difficulty in each pset. However, some psets are more rigorous than others (arrays: searching I is definitely harder than say Stacks - I). Usually, the first 30-40% are leetcode easies, followed my mostly leetcode mediums. Some are leetcode hard in between but I'm not one for spoilers. 


I'll try to make sure that each solution set has its own runtime complexity documented. I'll also try to find out that each problem also contain some requirement for time/space complexity. However, I don't promise that.

## Leetcode/hackerrank problems:

Every problem has their problem number in the file name, and runtime complexity in the code comments. I'm also trying to generate another readme and repo to organize common problem patterns like sliding window and two pointers, so that each of these patterns and their problems could be organized better

Enjoy your visit B|


## Tips:
1. Maintain a google docs / excel spreadsheet to log problems, focustime, and result (bruteforce/optimized/fail) so you could revisit problems later
2. Don't look at the solutions until you have failed on 2-3 separate occasions after devoting at-least 30 mins each
3. Do timed revisions on failed/challenging problems you marked on the spreadsheet.
4. Add next day's questions to spreadsheet.
