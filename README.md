# codingProblems

## About
 
This is a repository for organizing theory and problems for Computer Science's famous Data Structures and Algorithms. These are also numerous DSA problems/solutions in this repo, which I've compiled either myself or with the help of some very amazing peers that I've met over the years! Problems are compiled from Leetcode, Hackerrank and other famous CS problem websites like project Euler. This is the structure of the Repo


### Basics

####  * Linear Data Structures 

* Arrays
   * Sorting
   * Searching
* Recursion
* Linked lists
* Stack/queues

#### * Non-Linear Data Structures

* Trees
   * BST
   * Red/Black trees
   * Other interesting tree problems
* Graphs
   * Euler problems
   * DFS/BFS
   * Other interesting graph problems
   * Etc (anything interesting basically)

### Platforms
* Leetcode
* Hackerrank


##  Basics -> Psets: 
In the basics repo, there's theory/visualizations and any problems are generally in the increasing order of difficulty in each pset. However, some psets are more rigorous than others (arrays: searching I is definitely harder than say Stacks - I). Usually, the first 30-40% are leetcode easies, followed my mostly leetcode mediums. Some are leetcode hard in between but I'm not one for spoilers. 


I'll try to make sure that each solution set has its own runtime complexity documented. I'll also try to find out that each problem also contain some requirement for time/space complexity. However, I don't promise that.

## Leetcode/hackerrank problems:

Every problem has their problem number in the file name, and runtime complexity in the code comments. I'm also trying to generate another readme and repo to organize common problem patterns like sliding window and two pointers, so that each of these patterns and their problems could be organized better

## Tips:
1. Maintain a google docs / excel spreadsheet to log problems, focustime, and result (bruteforce/optimized/fail) so you could revisit problems later
2. Don't look at the solutions until you have failed on 2-3 separate occasions after devoting at-least 30 mins each
3. Do timed revisions on failed/challenging problems you marked on the spreadsheet.
